# April 6th, 2025

## Woovi

We are going to Woovi SPB production tomorrow.
Our bank code is 694.
Check it [here](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/estabilidadefinanceira/str1/ParticipantesSTR.pdf).

We are optimizing our code to pass SPI capacity load test.
We are also squeezing the last bugs from our implementation.
We are also improving our DX/UX on console to make debugging easier.

## Mentorship & Startup Consulting

I have mentorship for developers that are stuck in their carrers.

I also have consulting for startups that need help with their tech stack, Minimal Viable Product and Product Market Fit.

If you need help, you can book a session with me.
