## Hiring

We are hiring 3 midlevel/senior to work with us at Woovi.

Hiring is hard because most candidates do not have public work, and don't want to put some effort in a simple code challenge.

If you wanna a better change try to build these code challenges or something equivalent [https://github.com/woovibr/jobs](https://github.com/woovibr/jobs)

Try to answer these questions to perform well in the interview [https://gist.github.com/sibelius/45bb26427b39f6c691049305b2b1dd05](https://gist.github.com/sibelius/45bb26427b39f6c691049305b2b1dd05)
